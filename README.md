## Game

The game is a singleplayer version of the original pong game. 

Objective:
The main objective is that the ball must not touch the bottom of the screen. The ball can bounce on the walls, the roof and the paddle.

Controls: 
The paddle can be controlled with the 'A' and 'D' keys or clicking on the screen with the left mouse button. It moves with a constant speed and stops at the edge of the game area.

Points: Every bounce is worth one point. The ball does not speed up, it moves with a constant speed. The angle of the bounce  is determined randomly.
